# Getting Started with Create React App

This is my first full-stack project made with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Skills I used
### Front-End
- I use ReactJS as the front-end framework. \
- React Router are used to switch between pages.\
- Redux are for reading pieces of state and dispatching actions to update the information of the whole project. For example, when I add the product that I want to buy, the information in shopping cart will be updated as well by Redux.\
- I use styled-component inside each react jsx file instead of css, because I realize style-componnet is more easier to manage projects with massive amount of pages.\
- And I used MUI(Material-UI) for icons.\

### Back-End
- I used Express as the back-end framework.\
- MongoDB is to managed the data.\
- Dotenv is used to keep apis private.\
- JSON Web Token is for authorization and authentication. Products are opened to all users. Each user can access their own shopping cart by authentication. And only authorized user（Administrator） can access all user's information and cart's information.\
- To store information of products, users and orders, Firebase is used.\

### Deploy App
I use Heroku and Netlify to deploy the app.\



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
